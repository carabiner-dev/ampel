## An Introduction to the AMPEL Policy Engine

AMPEL is a policy engine specially crafted to protect the software development
lifecycle through trusted security metadata. It has native support for Software
Supply Chain Security technologies such as In-toto, Sigstore, SLSA, Protobom, etc
but it can also work with any kind of signed metadata.

The engine is extensible in various ways, from pluggable evaluation runtimes to
transformers and runtime plugins. It is designed to be embedable in software
powering software builds, packaging and delivery.

AMPEL is a backronym in search of a meaning. It currently stands for Amazing
Multipurpose Policy Engine (and L), so we are 80% there!

This is the AMPEL user manual. We do our best to keep these docs up to date,
but - as all software documentation - expect the manual to be always under
construction and always behind the latest version. As always, patches and
contributions are welcome!
