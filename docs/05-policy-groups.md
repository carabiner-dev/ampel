# Policy Groups

Policy Groups provide a way to organize policies into logical blocks within a
PolicySet. While a PolicySet can contain individual policies directly, groups
add an intermediate layer that bundles related policies together under a common
identity, control mapping and assertion logic.

## Why Policy Groups?

Individual policies in a PolicySet are evaluated independently. This works well
for simple scenarios but falls short when you need to:

- **Map multiple policies to a single framework control.** A security control
  like "MFA must be enabled for all maintainers" may require checking more than
  one attestation. A group ties these policies together under the control.
- **Express alternative compliance paths.** A group block can use `OR` assertion
  mode so that any one of several policies can satisfy the requirement.
- **Reuse curated collections.** Groups can be referenced from remote sources,
  letting you maintain shared policy bundles across repositories.

## Structure

A PolicyGroup is a JSON/HJSON document with three main parts:

```json
{
    "id": "OSPS-BR-01",
    "meta": {
        "description": "Build pipelines MUST NOT permit untrusted input",
        "controls": [
            { "framework": "OSPS", "class": "BR", "id": "01" }
        ]
    },
    "blocks": [
        {
            "id": "check-workflows",
            "policies": [
                {
                    "source": {
                        "location": { "uri": "git+https://example.com/policies#scorecard/dangerous-workflow.json" }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### ID

The group identifier. This shows up in evaluation results and is used to
reference the group in output tables.

### Metadata

The `meta` block carries information about the group:

- **description**: Human-readable description of what the group verifies.
- **controls**: A list of framework control mappings (framework, class, id).
  These tie the group to compliance framework requirements.
- **enforce**: Set to `"OFF"` to make the group produce `SOFTFAIL` instead of
  `FAIL` when evaluation does not pass.

### Blocks

A group contains one or more _blocks_. Each block is a collection of policies
that are evaluated together. Blocks have their own assertion logic:

```json
{
    "id": "mfa-checks",
    "meta": {
        "assert_mode": "AND",
        "controls": [
            { "framework": "OSPS", "class": "AC", "id": "01" }
        ]
    },
    "policies": [
        { "source": { "location": { "uri": "git+https://example.com/policies#mfa-all.json" } } },
        { "source": { "location": { "uri": "git+https://example.com/policies#mfa-admin.json" } } }
    ]
}
```

## Block Assertion Modes

Each block has an assertion mode that determines how its policies combine:

- **AND** (default): All policies in the block must pass for the block to pass.
- **OR**: At least one policy in the block must pass for the block to pass.

The assertion mode is set in the block's metadata:

```json
"meta": { "assert_mode": "OR" }
```

For the group itself to pass, all of its blocks must pass.

## Using Groups in a PolicySet

A PolicySet references groups in its `groups` field. Groups are typically
fetched from remote sources:

```json
{
    "id": "MyPolicySet",
    "groups": [
        {
            "source": {
                "location": {
                    "uri": "git+https://github.com/example/policies@main#groups/ac-01.hjson"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "source": {
                "location": {
                    "uri": "git+https://github.com/example/policies@main#groups/br-01.hjson"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

A PolicySet can contain both individual `policies` and `groups`. Both are
evaluated and their results are combined in the final ResultSet.

## Evaluation Results

When AMPEL evaluates a PolicySet containing groups, the results are structured
hierarchically:

```
ResultSet
 +-- Results       (from individual policies in the set)
 +-- Groups        (from policy groups)
      +-- Blocks   (block evaluation results within each group)
           +-- Results (individual policy results within each block)
```

In the default TTY output, each group is displayed as a single row showing:

| Column   | Content                                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy   | The group ID                                              |
| Controls | Framework control labels from the group metadata          |
| Status   | Overall PASS/FAIL for the group                          |
| Details  | Assessment messages (pass) or error messages (fail)       |

Use `--policy-out` to get detailed per-policy output that expands each group
into its individual block and policy results.

## Common Context

Like PolicySets, groups can define common context values that are shared across
all policies in the group. See the
[policy guide](03-ampel-policy-guide.md#common-context-in-policysets) for
details on how context values work.

```json
{
    "id": "my-group",
    "common": {
        "context": {
            "repo_name": {
                "required": true
            }
        }
    },
    "blocks": [ ... ]
}
```

## Example: OSPS Baseline

The [OSPS Security Baseline](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/policies) policy
set is a real-world example that uses groups extensively. It defines 36 groups,
each mapping to a specific OSPS framework control:

```json
{
    "id": "OSPS",
    "groups": [
        { "source": { "location": { "uri": "git+https://github.com/carabiner-dev/policies@main#groups/osps-baseline/osps-ac-01.hjson" } } },
        { "source": { "location": { "uri": "git+https://github.com/carabiner-dev/policies@main#groups/osps-baseline/osps-br-01.hjson" } } }
    ]
}
```

To evaluate the baseline against a subject:

```bash
ampel verify my-binary \
    -c jsonl:attestations.jsonl \
    -p 'git+https://github.com/carabiner-dev/policies#sets/baseline/osps-baseline.policy.json'
```
