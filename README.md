### The Amazing Multi-Purpose Policy Engine (and L)

Ampel is a lightweight supply chain policy engine designed to be embedded
across the software development lifecycle to make sure that source code,
tools and the build environment can be trusted by verifying unforgeable
metadata captured in signed attestations

## Attesting Metadata

Ampel works with attestations in the In-Toto format and has native verification
support for sigstore bundles. Signing schemes are pluggable meaning other
signature verification mechanisms can be added.

As a supply chain security tool, Ampel can work with common formats like 
[SLSA](https://slsa.dev) to check software provenance and SBOMs to gate on depedndency data, but policies can be written against any custom data in JSON.

The policy engine also supports __transformers__ that can read and verify attestations to then convert them to other formats simplify policy
authoring.

For example, by loading the vulnerability report transformer, Ampel
can transform the output of the common vulnerability scanners to a common format,such as OSV, allowing you to write a single policy to verify the findings of any scanner.

## The Ampel Ecosysten

Ampel is part of a growing ecosystem of tools that let software developers and
security engineers harden their SLDC processes. The more mature siblings of 
Ampel are:

- [bnd](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/bnd): A tool to attest, sign and verify 
data. It also has some features to work with attestations and sigstore bundles.

- [snappy](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/snappy): Takes snapshots of APIs to
attest their state.

- [unpack](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/unpack): A dependency extractor with
SBOM visualization and generation capabilities.

## Policies

Ampel uses a model of policies as code. The policy frame can be written in either
**JSON** or **HJSON** format (HJSON is recommended for better readability with
support for comments and relaxed syntax). The evaluation code is written in a
supported runtime. At present Ampel ships with a CEL (Common Expression Language)
runtime and more runtimes are in the roadmap.

### Policy Structure

The structure of an Ampel policy is described at length in its own documentation
At a higher level a policy consists of:

- Metadata
- Contextual Info
- Attestation Spec
- Identity Definition
- Tenets (one or more)

### Tenet

A policy's _tenets_ (those principles we hold to be true) are the core of the
policy. Each tenet represents a check Ampel will perform on the avilable evidence.

The tenet structure contains the evaluation code that will be executed to check
if the tenet holds true.

A policiy's tenets can be evaluated in two modes:

- `AND` a policy will evaluate to PASS when all tenets are true.
- `OR` a policy will `PASS` if at least one tenet evaluates to true. Useful when 
there is more than one way to check.

Think of tenets as questions to ask your attested data:

- Was this artifact built by my GitHub account?
- Does my vulnerability report contain HIGH CVEs?
- Does this repository have MFA enabled?
- Is this project licensed under an approved OSI license?
- ... and more.

## Link to Compliance Controls

A policy can be linked to a security framework control. WHen evaluating the 
compliance status iof artifacts againsta a security framework, Ampel can 
link the policies to controls and checks defined in OSCAL catalogs and profiles.

## Results and Results Attestations

Ampel can report the status of a policy or block processes when a policy evaluates
to `FAIL`. But the evaluation results are rich with metadata and human-friendly
messages which makes them suitable to display in various situations such as reports,
webpages, CI/CD systems, etc.

A powerful feature of Ampel is that evaluation results can also be attested.
This means that results can be used as input attestations for further policies,
making it simple to check for complex processes further downstream after the
have been checked once.

### Policy Sets

Multiple policies can be specified together in a `PolicySet`. This is a handy way 
to maintain policies that relate to each other in a single file to make them
available to the engine at evaluation time. The results of policies tied together
in a PolicySet can also be reported together in a ResultsSet.
